# Testing Recoil js

##### To run this project locally

Clone this project locally. Get inside the cloned folder. Then follow commands.

```
npm install
npm start
```

##### What does it do?

1. Shows how state is being managed without shifting component states to ancestors.
2. State can be used anywhere within same folder or even outside it.

   This reminds me of [useSelector ](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#useselector-examples)and [useDispatch ](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#usedispatch)hooks from redux. They server the same purpose as useRecoilState and useRecoilValue does
3. The impressive fact is the simplicity in setup. Redux would have taken more know-how and setup time. For small yet complex projects, [Recoil.js](https://recoiljs.org/) is really nice.
